# Cyber Tent – Agents Lab Notebook

## 📖 Overview
This project provides an interactive Jupyter Notebook (`Cyber Tent.ipynb`) designed for experimenting with AI agents. It includes setup instructions, API connections, and example usage of agents for security or automation workflows.

## 🚀 Features
- Agent-based experimentation environment.  
- Pre-configured **watsonx API connection**.  
- Step-by-step setup instructions.  
- Example workflows to demonstrate usage.  
- Written in **Python 3.10**.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Cyber Tent.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing code and documentation.  
- **Sections inside notebook**:
  - Agents Lab Notebook v1.0.0  
  - Notebook goals  
  - Setup  
  - watsonx API connection  
  - Using the agent  

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.10  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- Required Python packages (install via `pip`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

*(You should create a `requirements.txt` with the libraries used inside the notebook, e.g., `ibm-watsonx`, `requests`, `pandas`, etc.)*

## ▶️ Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.  
2. Install dependencies.  
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Cyber Tent.ipynb`.  
5. Follow the steps inside to connect to the watsonx API and start using the agent.  

## 📌 Notes
- Ensure you have API credentials for **IBM watsonx** before running the notebook.  
- Modify the agent logic as needed for your use case.
